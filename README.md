Scala Sample for Parallel Computation by Akka Actors
====================================================

Christoph Knabe, 2016-12-18

This sample program computes the sum of integers from 1 up to but excluding an upper limit n.
Although this could be done quickly by the so-called Gau√ü formula (n-1)*n/2, here it is done by sequential loops
in order to benchmark the sequential vs. parallel solutions.

It computes it in two manners.

1) The total sum is computed by one sequential loop.

2) The task is distributed to so many SumUpActor-s as are available cores in the JVM. 
   The actors return their partial results to the ManagerActor, which sums them up and returns the total sum to the TestSuite.
   
The acceleration with parallelization is thereby demonstrated.
